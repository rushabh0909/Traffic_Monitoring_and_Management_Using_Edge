  The Traffic Management and Monitoring System is designed to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion using real-time data analysis. The system integrates multiple cameras at traffic signals to collect vehicle data, which is processed using edge computing device Jetson Nano. By analyzing traffic density, the system dynamically adjusts signal timings to prioritize heavily congested lanes. Additionally, it provides real-time traffic updates and suggests the best routes through a user-friendly website or mobile application. This solution leverages advanced algorithms to enhance urban traffic management, ensuring smoother commutes and reducing delays effectively.
